# Small OS

(work in progress)

`smlos` is a small operating system written in G language, and runs on
Small VM. It also follows the Small VM coding rule: every file <300
lines, and no circular dependencies among files.

G language uses a syntax that is a strict subset of Go language's.

The architecture of the OS largely references Nachos and JOS.
