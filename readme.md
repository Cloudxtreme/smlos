# OS8

(work in progress)

`os8` is a small operating system written in G language, and runs on
E8VM. It also follows the E8VM coding rule: every file <300 lines, and
no circular dependencies among files.

G language uses a syntax that is a strict subset of Go language's.

The architecture of the OS largely references Nachos and JOS.
