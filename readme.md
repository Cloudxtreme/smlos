(work in progress)

A small operating system written in G language, and runs on E8VM. It
also follows the E8VM coding rule: every file <300 lines, and no
circular dependencies among files.

This small OS is written in G language. It is a  strict subset of Go
language in terms of syntax.

The architecture of the OS references Nachos and JOS.
